# Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC) Framework Portal

Welcome to the official portal for the Fractal Resonance Cognition framework, developed by Hadi Servat.

## What is Fractal Resonance Cognition?

FRC is a pioneering theoretical framework for complex systems analysis that proposes complex systems are governed by vortex-like attractor structures with fractal scaling and resonant dynamics. These dynamics manifest as self-similar patterns in spatial, spectral, or temporal properties.
